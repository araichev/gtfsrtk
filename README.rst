GTFSrTK
********
A Python 3.4+ toolkit to process General Transit Feed Specification Realtime (GTFSr) data.
Uses Pandas to do the heavy lifting.


Notes
======
- Development status is Alpha
- Only works on GTFSr feeds in JSON format. I'll incorporate the protobuf format once `the Python 3 binding for protobuf gets fixed <https://github.com/google/gtfs-realtime-bindings/issues/17>`_.
