GTFSRTK is a tiny Python 3.5+ toolkit to process `General Transit Feed Specification Realtime (GTFSR) data <https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/reference>`_.
It does some simple things like read and write Protocol Buffer or JSON feed files.
It also does some complex things like extract and combine delays into DataFrames using Pandas.
